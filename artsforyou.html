    <h1>Are the arts for you?
Posted by The Editors on December 3, 2012</h1>
    <p>J-Lo. Heath Ledger. Bono. 50 Cent. Alicia Keys. Jerry Seinfeld. Clint Black. Mikhail Baryshnikov. Jennifer Aniston. It may seem like a diverse list, but all these folks have at least one thing in common: They're performing artists. Performing artists
      do just what they advertise: they perform. Whether it's live or on film or video, they act, sing, play music, dance, tell jokes, or otherwise entertain us. While other artists, such as writers, sculptors, or painters, are focused on creating or
      producing things like short stories or paintings, performing artists channel their talents into performances that entertain, amuse, provoke, and delight. Because of the fame and fortune accorded those who succeed in Hollywood, on TV, in theater,
      and in concert halls, untold millions are drawn toward careers in the performing arts. Very few succeed financially (the notion of the "starving artist" is well founded). Only those with determination, talent, discipline, and luck manage to find
      careers in the performing arts in which they can support themselves.</p>
